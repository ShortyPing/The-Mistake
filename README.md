# The Mistake

Hey there, I see you made it here.  
Congratulations — you’ve officially crossed into my personal descent into madness.

This repository is my **self-invitation to a psychiatric institution**. Why?  
Because somewhere around 2 AM, I decided it was a good idea to write a **raytracer in COBOL** — yes, *that* COBOL.  
The same COBOL your grandma’s bank still uses to figure out interest on a savings account she forgot she even had.  
*(Fun fact: your grandma’s Account still pays more interest than my brain after this project.)*

## What is this?

- A raytracer.  
- Written in COBOL.  
- That outputs a PPM image.  
- With delightfully primitive **1960s style graphics**, because nothing says *avant-garde* like 3D spheres painstakingly rendered by a language that thinks “OOP” stands for *“Old, Obsolete, Pain.”*

It features:
- A blue background (to reflect the tears I shed coding this).  
- A single red sphere (representing my last neuron valiantly holding on).  
- Lambertian shading (to prove I can still Google formulas at 3 AM).  
- Fixed light source (because adding flexibility would have required sanity, which I lost around the 15th compute statement).

## Why?

Because at 2 in the morning, my brain decided:  
> “Hey, wouldn’t it be hilarious if you did raytracing in COBOL instead of literally any sane language?”

Turns out:  
- It was.  
- It *really* was.  
- But also:  
- **I now hear colors, smell recursion, and occasionally taste segmentation faults.**

## How to run

1. Install a COBOL compiler. *(If you didn’t run away screaming yet, congratulations on being just as broken as me.)*
2. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   make all run
   ```
3. Behold `output.ppm` — the pixelated culmination of my therapy needs.  
4. Open it with anything that reads PPM, or convert it to something more viewable:
   ```bash
   convert output.ppm output.png
   ```
5. Stare into the abyss. Watch it stare back. Wonder if COBOL is secretly alive and mocking you.

## Possible FAQ

**Q: Why not just use Python, Rust, literally anything else?**  
A: Because I don’t make good life choices.

**Q: Is this fast?**  
A: Absolutely not. But it’s ironically future-proof: COBOL might outlive us all.

**Q: Does this compile everywhere?**  
A: Only on machines that still maintain ritual COBOL sacrifices to the compiler gods.

## License

MIT, because if you somehow make money off this, I’ll need you to pay for my therapy sessions, additional coffee, and maybe a new frontal lobe.
