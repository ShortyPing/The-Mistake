# The Mistake

Hey there, I see you made it here.  
Congratulations — you’ve officially crossed into my personal descent into madness.

This repository is my **self-invitation to a psychiatric institution**. Why?  
Because somewhere around 2 AM, I decided it was a good idea to write a **raytracer in COBOL** — yes, *that* COBOL.  
The same COBOL your grandma’s bank still uses to figure out interest on a savings account she forgot she even had.

## What is this?

- A raytracer.  
- Written in COBOL.  
- That outputs a PPM image.  
- With delightfully primitive **1960s style graphics**, because nothing says *high art* like 3D spheres rendered by a language designed for accountants.

It features:
- A blue background (for the tears).  
- A single red sphere (representing my last neuron).  
- Lambertian shading (so you know I suffered).  
- Fixed light source (because flexibility is for sane people).

## Why?

Because at 2 in the morning, my brain went:
> “Hey, wouldn’t it be hilarious if you did raytracing in COBOL instead of literally any sane language?”

Turns out:  
- It was.  
- But also:  
- **I now hear colors and smell recursion.**  
Hence, the psychiatric invitation.

## How to run

1. Install a COBOL compiler. (If you didn’t run away screaming yet.)
2. Compile:
   ```bash
   make all run```
3. Behold `output.ppm` — the pixelated culmination of my therapy needs.
4. Open it with anything that reads PPM, or convert it:
   convert output.ppm output.png
